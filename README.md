# Smart Fish Feeder

Designed and implemented a cloud-connected smart fish feeder using AWS IoT Core, Lambda, API Gateway, SNS, and S3 for automated and remote-controlled feeding. The system was built with a Raspberry Pi 3B, servo motor, and MQTT-based communication for real-time feeding commands and scheduling. Developed a secure WebUI (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) hosted on AWS S3, enabling users to set feeding schedules, trigger manual feedings, and receive email notifications of feeding activities. Leveraged Python for device-side control and AWS Lambda functions for serverless backend processing, ensuring scalable and reliable cloud integration.
